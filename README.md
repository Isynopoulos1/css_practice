## HI

I'm Isela, UI/UX designer and a big fan of dogs. One of the things what I like the most about Barcelona is the amount of cute and well-educated dogs that I see on the street. I called this project: "Perritos Waiting". Waiting for their owners outside the shops, supermarkets, charcuteries, bakeries, hum... everywhere! I can't avoid taking photos of them, and I want to share some of my random photos on this site. So, if you are like me, you'll enjoy this corny website, I hope you like it!
